This game was created as my university project and written on C using CSFML

"Filler". The purpose of the game is to paint more colored cells than a computer. At the beginning of the game, the territory of the player - in the upper left corner, the territory of the computer - in the lower right. You can only select cells that are located next to the existing territory. After move, the territory acquires the color of the chosen cell, and all the adjacent cells of the same color join it. You can not select cells in the color of the opponent's territory.
